### Application to enroll in the micro-credential

<p align="justify">
Up to 35 attendees will be accepted. To register, applicants must complete the form provided (link below). Based on our experience with the CAMLC24 edition, we anticipate receiving a high number of applications that will be evaluated through a two-step selection process:<br><br>
&#9900; An initial automated and bias-free pre-selection process based on responses from the form<br>
&#9900; From the remaining candidates, a panel of professors will select the final applicants, considering the potential value of the micro-credential for them (based on their motivation letter and CV)
</p><br>

<i>We are not accepting applications yet. We will be accepting application in early 2025, more details on the process will be posted soon!</i></p><br>
